                    <h2>About this site</h2>

                    <p>This is my personal site, my little home away from the annoying-ness of social media. This site is very much a work in progress and I hope I can make it a great place.</p>

                    <p>This site will have blog posts about various things. I will always have trigger warnings on my posts when necessary. (And if you don't know, the acronym "tw" means trigger warning)</p>

                    <p>Like social media and how it's 13+ I would like to have this site be 13+. This means that if you're under thirteen I'd rather not have you on the site. This is for safety reasons, not because I have something against minors below thirteen.</p>

                    <p>Because I know some kids ignore boundaries like it's their day job, here's a message to all the people under thirteen who are about to explore this site anyway: be careful. If you see a trigger warning that you don't understand the meaning of just assume it's something you shouldn't read or look at.</p>
