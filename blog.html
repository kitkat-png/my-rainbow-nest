                    <h2>Things I really want to do</h2>
                    <p class="small-italic">Date posted: 9/18/2024</p>

                    <p>This post is about things I really want to do. I wanted to get some of this stuff on paper (or I guess, on a screen) both because I'm bored and because it might help me get more motivation to complete some of these goals.</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Read More</summary>
                        <p>The first thing I really want to do is learn how to sew. I don't really have money for a sewing machine, but I probably won't need that until I've already learned to do the basics by hand. I was thinking I'd make stuff like bags and accessories and work myself up to things like dresses! There are a few reasons I want to learn how to sew. One reason is because it will probably be good for my mental health because it's less time on a screen, more time doing stuff with my hands. Another reason is because I wanna make more things. A third reason is because in the long run it might save me some money.</p>

                        <p>The second thing I really want to do is finish my school stuff. Once I finish high school and then college I'll be able to start doing stuff that earns me actual money and that's one of the main reasons I'm motivated to finish that stuff. Another reason I wanna finish all my schoolwork is because I'm bored.</p>

                        <p>The third thing I really want to do is work harder on improving my mental health. I have three main reasons I want to do this. First reason is because I want to feel better, second is because I wanna become a better person (and dealing with my mental health issues will probably help with that), and the third reason is because I wanna make friends. (Not being a mess will probably help me with being friends.)</p>

                        <p>In conclusion, I have a lot of things I wanna do but these are some of the main things. I hope seeing some of my plans gets you guys into the planning/motivation spirit! Also, I'm turning 20 soon so I hope I can manage to get stuff done before then and after then. If I turn 21 and I still haven't accomplished any of this stuff I'll be big mad at myself.</p>

                    <p>I've been thinking about adding a dark mode to this site but at the same time I feel like any dark mode I could make would be so boring compared to how the site is right now.</p>

                    <h2>Hiding Places</h2>
                    <p class="small-italic">Date posted: 9/7/2024</p>

                    <p>There was a point where I didn't realize that having a place to hide was important for me. Sure, I knew that it was important to have a hiding place at school but I didn't know that I would ever need one at home. In the last house I lived in (aka, my childhood home) when I'd go in my room it would be a safe place for the most part. Unless somebody decided to bother me there wasn't much sound at all.</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Read More</summary>
                        <p>The current house I live in is different. The walls are thin and my older sister's in the next room. And since my room is right next to the stairs I can hear even more than everyone else. As an autistic person with sound sensitivities, even the smallest of sounds have the potential to bother me. The sound of the fan for example. When I'm already overwhelmed the sound of the fan feels almost like nails on a chalkboard.</p>

                        <p>And one problem that has existed ever since I lived in my old house is a certain family member's tendency not to knock and to just start lecturing me about some random thing that isn't my fault a lot of the time. For example, I'd have a social difficulty that I didn't know how to fix and she'd come and complain to me about it without offering any solutions other than 'just stop doing that.' (Which I had already tried, obviously.)</p>

                        <p>Because of these things hiding places are very important to me. It means so much to me to have a place I can go where it's quiet, dark, and where it's not super easy to locate me. At my old house one hiding place that I had was my closet. My closet there had a nice amount of room in it and it was dark and I regret not taking advantage of that hiding spot more.</p>

                        <p>My current house has no hiding places. My closet is too small to comfortably hide in, I can't fit underneath my bed, and the one place that would work as a hiding place in my house is currently occupied. Not having a hiding place has screwed up my mental health immensely. Basically, it makes it so I don't have a safe place. Every place is a place where I'll probably get overwhelmed which means there are hardly any times where I can even attempt to fully relax. (Except for when I go to sleep but sometimes the noise in my house means I can't even go to sleep when I want to!)</p>

                        <p>I want to try hiding under my blanket when I get overwhelmed and making it clear to others that when I'm hiding underneath it I'm in 'do not disturb' mode but that has obvious problems. Like for example, what do I do when I'm overheated? What do I do if I get overstimulated by the weight of the blanket on me? What do I do if somebody decides to bother me anyway? (These are all questions for myself not you by the way.)</p>

                        <p>Hopefully in my future home I'll have some hiding places. If everything goes how I want it to I might even make some secret entrances in my house so that some of my hiding places can be completely hidden away.</p>

                        <p>In conclusion, I wish I had a good hiding place but for now most of what I can do is just hope the future gives me access to more hiding places.</p>

                    <h2>Tagging System</h2>
                    <p class="small-italic">Date posted: 9/5/2024</p>

                    <p>I am so excited about this website having a working tagging system. As I am writing this post I have just made the tagging system.</p>

                    <p>The code is kinda repetitive, but at least it works. I tried doing a part of it with a function (so it wouldn't be as repetitive) but it didn't work for some reason.</p>

                    <h2>My cats and how they have helped me</h2>
                    <p class="small-italic">Date posted: 9/5/2024</p>

                    <p>TW: childhood trauma (not described)</p>
                    
                    <p>Getting cats was totally unexpected for me. Me getting attached to them was even more unexpected. They originally belonged to my older sister and her friend but over time ownership has switched over to me and my mom, with me being closer with one cat and my mom being closer with the other.</p>
                    
                    <details>
                        <summary>Read More</summary>
                        <p>The cats' names are Frederick and Charlie. They're both gray cats though Frederick has some white markings. They are brothers and even though they fight sometimes it's obvious once you get to know them that they care about each other. Even though I didn't know them when they were kittens I feel like I've known them through a few important milestones. One of those milestones was Frederick catching his first mouse.</p>

                        <p>They help me in many ways, one of those main ways being emotional support. Even when some days feel more inconsistent I can feel safe knowing that the cats are there. They are helpful when I'm really upset as well. Frederick especially knows just how to distract me from bad thoughts. They also help fill a void that has been there for a long time- the void that comes with not having many people you can trust as a child.</p>

                        <p>Plus, as of right now my relationships with Frederick and Charlie are the only relationships I have that aren't tainted by any baggage. I don't have to wonder why they didn't do anything to help me when I was a kid because they weren't alive then. I don't have to feel guilty for exposing them to my issues because they probably wouldn't understand most of it even if I explained.</p>

                        <p>Sure, there are some difficulties that come with having cats. I feel so tired most days that it is difficult to consistently take care of their litter box. It can also be difficult because I have certain other people living in my house that I'd rather avoid and sometimes that isn't compatible with me doing the litter box consistently. I wouldn't give the cats up for anything, though.</p>

                        <p>There have been so many times the cats (Frederick especially) have saved me from going off the deep end. I have to keep these cats because I owe them a good life for all they have done for me. I have to protect them from anyone who could hurt them because they have protected me from myself. I have to feed them and give them water because if they could they'd probably do that same stuff for me.</p>

                        <p>In conclusion, my cats are very important to me and they have helped me in a lot of ways. The past few years have been very difficult for me but thanks to my cats I've been able to keep going. I hope that the rest of their lives are filled with hope, happiness, and health and that I can be the best cat owner I can be.</p>
